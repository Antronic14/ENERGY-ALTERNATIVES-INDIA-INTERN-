# CLIMAFIX Homepage Redesign - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from leading innovation summit and conference platforms (TED, Web Summit, Slush, Y Combinator events) that successfully blend visual impact with information clarity. The design emphasizes CLIMAFIX Summit 2025 as the hero while maintaining the platform's intelligence offerings.

## Core Design Principles

2. **Impact Through Imagery**: Leverage group photos, speaker headshots, and event visuals to build credibility
3. **Data-Driven Trust**: Display statistics and numbers prominently to convey scale and authority
